Tips for writing functions: 

- Don't write in values within the function 


This is an inline function. It is local to the markdown file that you made it on. If is best practice to write function in its own R file 

```{r}
streamflow = function( precip, ET, ds) {
  
  Q = precip - ET + ds 
 
  if (Q < 0) {warning(print("Q is negative"))}
  
  return(Q)
}
```



Here is how you source a function 
```{r}
library(here)
source(here("sections", "week2", "streamflow.R"))
```
